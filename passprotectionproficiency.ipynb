If a team could sign the 5 players with the higest PPP scores, their salaries would total about 27M dollars per year.\n\nSurprisingly, if a team were to sign the 5 highest paid offensive lineman, their salaries would total about 74 millions dollars per year, but the chance of a negative event on a passing play would still be a whopping 44% (for breakdown of above please see last cell in notebook,'cell-19, Discussion of PPP Impact').\n\nInitial exploration of player data (PPP derived from pffScouting, physical attributes, Combine, salary) showed that experience (using age as a proxy) is\nbetter correlated with PPP than athleticism (see cell-15 in notebook).\n\nThe analysis suggests that NFL teams are not optimal in aligning offensive line salaries with PPP (see cell-15 in notebook).\nThe mystery of how offensive lineman salaries are set is not revealed by the analysis.\nThis analysis did not inlcude run blocking proficiency which could explain some of the seeming misalignment of salary with performance.\n\nPerhaps the most novel and hopefuly useful aspect of the analysis is that it provides support for my 'weak-link-in-the-chain' theory.\nSmart defensive coordiantors have figured out that it only takes one defender in the backfield to blow-up a play.\nFittingly they will look for the match-up against the 'weak link' in the offesnsive line.\nKnowing this, offensive lines should attempt to balance the PPP across the line, maximizing the PPP of their weakest player.\nThe analysis shows offensive lines with this characteristic achieve a better overall team PPP (see cell-18 in notebook).\nDependent on how the data is prepared the overall Team PPP is equally or more correlated with the weakest PPP (among the top 5)\nthan the strongest PPP among the top 5 highest paid.\n\nHowever, this may be a happy accident for some of these teams.\nLooking at the average offensive line salary distribution across teams (see cell-19 in notebook),\none might conclude that having a tackle 'super' block his defender somehow offsets the guard's poor pass blocking.\n\nConclusion:\nWhen it comes building an offensive line that is effective at pass protection,\nteams should consider building a line that is optimally balanced in respect to PPP with no weak spots,\nseeking candidates among the more experienced that have demostrated pass-blocking skill (according to PPP),\nwith less focus on physical attributes and athleticism.\n\nFuture Work:\nI would like to build a Bayesian predictive model that leverages PPP\nand can calculate risk of negative event in real-time based on context of the play:\n1. play called\n2. specific offensive lineman in game\n3. field postion\n4. score and quarter\n5. specific defenders in game\n6. defensive alignment\n7. QB mobility\n8. QB decision-making\n\nThis repository contains 'PPP_Analysis.ipynb' notebook (and data files) which walks through the analysis summarized above.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Cell-1\nThis notebook contains the steps for \ncalculating new statistic, PassProtectionProficiency (PPP).\nIt then explores how it might be combined with other \noffensive lineman attrributes and salary information\nto evaluate my weak-link theory as described \nin https://github.com/mikekubal/PassProtectionProficiency/edit/main/README.md.\n\nOutline:\n1. New statistic PPP (pass-protection-proficiency) is metric for measuring individual or team performance.\n2. Salaries for offensive linemen in NFL are more correlated with athlectic ability than PPP.\n3. Overall team PPP is more correlated with maximizing proficency of weakest blocker than strongest blocker.\n4. Implications\n\n#1.PPP (pass-protection-proficiency) is metric for measuring individual or team performance.\nPPP is simply a ratio of total plays where a linemen was in pass protection role to\ntotal negative events (lineman got beat or was responsible for QB being pressured, hit or sacked).\nA PPP of 10 equates to a ration of 9 positive plays to 1 negative play. \nA positive play is simply a passing play without a negative event.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Cell-2\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport
